Subject:	Oneok Bushton- An Additional Delay in Decision
The panel has requested an additional week to come up with a decision in this case and all parties have agreed.  The decision is now expected to be handed down on Friday, June 29.  Again, I will let you know the outcome as soon as we receive word.
