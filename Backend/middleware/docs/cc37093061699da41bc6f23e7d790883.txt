Subject:	10-K Deadlines
As discussed in the earnings meeting, we are currently planning to file the 10-K the week of February 12.  To do that, I need all groups to meet the deadlines which were communicated to you at year end.  Several items were due yesterday and today which have not been received by my group.  Also, please be sure to review all information.
If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call.
