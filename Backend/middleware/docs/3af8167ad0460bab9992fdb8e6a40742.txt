I think Mike was referring to the revised time table that we discussed in the last upload meeting.  We were going to have all templates uploaded by the 15th, then work with Lee to schedule running the plan assessments on the 20th, etc.  You had mentioned that you would publish the target dates after talking to Lee.

Tracy,
Have you published the final upload schedule?  If so, I was not on the distribution list.
Thanks!
