As recently seen on Houston TV, BSE
or Mad Cow Disease, is a widespread
concern especially here in Houston
because of the world wide participation in
the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
Please foward this simple yet effective
test to all those who are associated with
or are actual participants in the HLSR.
It is believed that this act may raise confidence
levels and eliminate unwarranted histeria.
Thank you very much.
