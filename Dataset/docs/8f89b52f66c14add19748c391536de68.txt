Ken Powers has been developing a Business Objects report along with Lindy Donoho and Jim Wiltfong.  They are trying to create a daily system balancing report by capturing reciepts, deliveries, fuel, OBA and Park and Ride activity  - all per pipeline segment.   The objective is to get a better handle on fuel.
